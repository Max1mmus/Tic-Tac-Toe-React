# Tic-Tac-Toe React version

This is (was) my first encounter with React.  
Take a look at :pushpin:[Live version!](https://max1mmus.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-React/)

#### Sample:

<img src='sample.jpg' width='400px' />

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Inspired by [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment) tutorial.
