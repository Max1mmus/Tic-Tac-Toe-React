# Tic-Tac-Toe React version

This is my first encounter with React.

I used pointers from [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment).

I still haven't implemented all tutorial solutions because I'm still wrapping my head around all of it,
and that's why some of solutions in my code are maybe not the best possible ones.

To implement :

* [ ] Time travel, past moves

#### Sample:

<img src='sample.jpg' width='400px' />

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
